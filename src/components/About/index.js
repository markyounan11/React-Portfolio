                        Thank you for visiting my website! My name is Mark Younan and I am a Full Stack Software Engineer in the San Francisco Bay area. My whole life, I've always had a fascination with technology and figuring out new, more efficient ways to complete every day tasks in order to make life easier. I am a self-motivated problem solver and challenge seeker who thrives best when working in a team. I merge a passion for usability and user experience with technical knowledge to create seamless digital experiences. Iâ€™m eager to always be learning new technologies and frameworks. When I am not at work, I enjoy playing golf, watching basketball, going to the beach and being out in nature. I'm also into super cars and I love and spending time with my family.
